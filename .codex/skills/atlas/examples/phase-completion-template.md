  - JSON index syntax: data["key"] ✅
  - Type extraction methods: .as_string(), .as_number(), .as_bool() ✅
  - JSON object workaround: String building + parseJSON() ✅
  - File I/O with proper security context ✅

## Critical Rules

**DO:**
- Keep total under 40 lines
- Use bullets (not tables)
- Status MUST be "✅ ALL ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA MET" (or phase incomplete)
- Highlights = 2-3 sentences + key bullets
- End with clear next step

**DON'T:**
- Add complex tables
- List every file modified (only mention if critical)
- Write paragraphs (bullets only)
- Exceed 40 lines
- Leave ANY failing tests (fix them ALL first)

**If ANY test fails: Phase incomplete. DO NOT hand off. Fix failures first.**
