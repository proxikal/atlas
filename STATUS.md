## v0.3 Block Progress

| Block | Theme | Phases | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Memory Model (CoW value types, replace Arc<Mutex<>>) | 25 | ✅ Complete (2026-02-21) |
| 2 | Ownership Syntax (`own`, `borrow`, `shared`) | 16 | ✅ Complete (2026-02-22) |
| 3 | Trait System (`trait`, `impl`, Copy/Move/Drop) | 18 | ✅ Complete (2026-02-22) |
| 4 | Closures + Anonymous Functions | 15–20 | ⬜ Blocked on Block 3 |
| 5 | Type Inference (locals + return types) | 10–15 | ⬜ Blocked on Block 3 |
| 6 | Error Handling (`?` operator) | 10–15 | ⬜ Blocked on Block 3 |
| 7 | JIT Integration (wire atlas-jit to VM) | 10–15 | ⬜ Unblocked — ready to scaffold |
| 8 | Async/Await Syntax | 10–15 | ⬜ Blocked on Block 6 |
| 9 | Quick Wins (string interp, implicit returns) | 5–10 | ⬜ Unblocked — ready to scaffold |

**Rule:** Blocks are strictly sequential within their dependency chain. Block N cannot begin
until all acceptance criteria in its dependency block are met. See V03_PLAN.md.

## v0.2 — COMPLETE ✅

**Completed:** 2026-02-21 (including post-v0.2 fixes)
**Total phases:** 133/133 + 6/6 completion phases

## Handoff Protocol

**When you complete a phase:**
1. Mark ⬜ → ✅ in the Block Progress table above
2. Update "Last Updated" date
3. Check memory (GATE 7)
4. Commit → merge to local main → rebase worktree/dev
5. Report completion

**When you complete a full block:**
1. Verify ALL acceptance criteria in `V03_PLAN.md` for that block
2. Run full test suite — must be 100% passing
3. Update block status to ✅ Complete
4. Only then begin the next dependent block
