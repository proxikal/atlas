# Line Limits (Compiler-Aware)

**Target:** 1000 lines (soft target)
**Reality:** Compiler modules often 600-2000 lines
**Rule:** Quality and correctness over arbitrary limits

---

## Philosophy

- **Complex compiler components may exceed 1000 lines with justification**
- **Never simplify code just to meet line counts**
- **Correctness > arbitrary metrics**

---

**This is compiler infrastructure, not application code. Embrace necessary complexity.**
