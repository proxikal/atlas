# Testing Protocol

**This file is DEPRECATED.** The single source of truth for testing patterns is:

**`memory/testing-patterns.md`**

It contains:
- The 17 canonical test files (domain file list)
- File-based corpus workflow (preferred for new features)
- Parity testing with `assert_parity()`
- `#[ignore]` rules
- Test execution commands (nextest)
- Quality standards and minimum test counts

All testing guidance in this skill defers to that file.
