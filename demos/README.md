# Atlas Demos

## Available

### `feature-showcase/`
Demonstrates current language capabilities: strings, arrays, math, collections,
Option/Result/match, regex, datetime, JSON, file I/O, and reflection.

```bash
atlas run demos/feature-showcase/main.atl
```

## Coming After Block 4

Real-world demos (HTTP, file processing, data pipelines, CLI tools) will be built
once closures, anonymous functions, and ownership syntax are complete.
Writing them before those features exist means rewriting them again immediately.
