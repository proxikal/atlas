# v0.1 Documentation Archive

**Purpose:** Historical context from v0.1 development phase

These documents describe v0.1 design decisions and context. They are preserved for historical reference but are NOT current guidance for development.

## Archived Files

### ir.md
**Context:** v0.1 decision to compile AST directly to bytecode without separate typed IR
**Status:** Historical - describes why v0.1 doesn't have typed IR
**Note:** May be revisited in future research, but not active guidance

### modules.md
**Context:** v0.1 module system design sketch (not implemented)
**Status:** Historical - early design thinking about modules
**Note:** Module system is in v0.2 foundation phases for actual implementation

### language-comparison.md
**Context:** Early draft comparing Atlas to other languages
**Status:** Historical - incomplete draft
**Note:** Philosophy is better captured in AI-MANIFESTO.md and ai-principles.md

### runtime-api-evolution.md
**Context:** v0.1 notes on API evolution
**Status:** Historical - brief v0.1-specific notes
**Note:** Current API evolution policy is in API-COMPATIBILITY.md

### keyword-policy.md
**Context:** v0.1 keyword management approach
**Status:** Historical - may still be relevant but v0.1-specific
**Note:** Review if needed, but archived for being v0.1-specific
